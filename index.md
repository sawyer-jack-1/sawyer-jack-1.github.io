I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at [UC San Diego](https://math.ucsd.edu/) and I am grateful to be advised by [Alex Cloninger](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/alexandercloninger/home). My research interests are primarily in the computational aspects of spectral graph theory, which include topics such as: effective resistance, signed and connection Laplacians, discrete curvature of graphs, optimal transportation, clustering and community detection methods on graphs, random graphs, and beyond.

You may find some of my work or follow me at my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lGEr_VoAAAAJ&hl=en). You can also view some of my code snippets at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/sawyer-jack-1) as well.

My [curriculum vitae is available here](/assets/cv/SJR_CV_Sept25-2.pdf) (Updated September 2025).
