Since Fall 2020 I have served in a variety of instructional and research roles at UCSD: as a teaching assistant, associate instructor, graduate student researcher. 

# Lecture Notes

In Summer 2025 I prepared a set of lecture notes for the course [DSC 40A: Theoretical Foundations of Data Science](assets/teaching/tfds_book.pdf).
Be warned that these notes are still a work in progress and contain typos and errors.
